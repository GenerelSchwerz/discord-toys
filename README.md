# Discord toys

I'm going to rewrite some old tools of mine to be updated to modern versions of Discord.

These are not going to be the final products--these will be the *python prototypes* of my projects.

If you understand rust, you can talk to me about getting the real versions. I don't give out *good* code to people who don't understand it.

Granted, my bad code will be better than everyone else's still, but that's not the point. I compete with myself, not with others.
